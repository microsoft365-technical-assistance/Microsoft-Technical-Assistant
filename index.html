            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 1: Contact Microsoft Support</h3>
                <p>As a first step, you can defuse the problem by getting help from a Microsoft Customer Service Advisor. You can contact the team by phone. The Microsoft toll-free number is quoted in the paragraphs above. You are reachable on weekdays from
                    9:00 AM to 9:00 PM and on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Use this call as much as possible by having Microsoft account information in the product causing the issue. Remember to keep calm because your interlocutor is not responsible
                    for your problems.</p>
                <p>Most conflicts end during this exchange and take place through different media as well. E-mail, contact form, messages on social networks, you have different ways to reach Microsoft customer service. The interactive online support is effective
                    too. You can get in touch with the Microsoft team. However, even if it is rare, sometimes the outcome of this conversation is not productive. If you wish to pursue your complaint, you can write an official letter. Let’s take stock
                    of the situation and realization of this letter in the following paragraph.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Draft A Complaint Letter</h3>
                <p>Are you facing issues with Microsoft? You will settle it quickly in principle. If contacting <b>Microsoft Customer Service</b> was not enough, you can always send an official complaint letter. If you want it to be read by the highest authorities,
                    you can send it to the <span>French head office of the firm located at 37 Quai du Président Roosevelt, 92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux.</span></p>
                <P>This letter must include contact details as well as information on the hardware or the Microsoft software concerned. You must explain the facts in neutral French and, above all, without getting carried away. Ask precisely what you want
                    at the end of this message. You will find templates for this type of letter for free on the net. Keep a copy, and if you provide additional information such as invoices or other documents, keep the copies. This may be useful to you
                    in the event of a dispute that requires the intervention of a neutral arbitrator such as a mediator. The answer should be quick, as companies such as Microsoft are concerned about <b>customer satisfaction.</b></P>
                <p>If you do not win your case, or even if you still haven’t got satisfactory results, you will be able to go to the next step: mediation.</p>
                <h3>Step 3: Apply for Mediation</h3>
                <p>Mediation is a <b>free procedure</b> for individuals to unclog the courts with disputes between opposing professionals to be easily resolved. Thus, if you can provide proof that you have attempted conciliation by yourself with Microsoft
                    and that it has failed, you can therefore obtain help from a mediator. You have one year from the date of your complaint to seize the mediator. The constitution of the file can take time, according to the complexity of this one, it
                    could take up to <b>3 months</b>, sometimes more, for the treatment. </p>
                <p>We’ll examine your request, and you will be notified by an acknowledgment of receipt. If the process is validated, you will receive a letter indicating its feasibility. Otherwise, you will also be notified. You will be asked for all the
                    documents for the claim to study your file. Don’t forget, that the role of the mediator is neutral. He must have in his possession all the elements necessary to judge your case. </p>
                <p>A solution will be proposed to you by the mediator. If it does not suit you, you can then seize the competent judge. Indeed, if mediation fails, the only way out is to go to court through a lawyer. Hence, this type of procedure will be
                    expensive.</p>
